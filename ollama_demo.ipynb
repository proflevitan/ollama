            " The sky appears blue due to a process called Rayleigh scattering. As sunlight reaches Earth, it's made up of different colors of light, each with varying wavelengths. Short-wavelength light (blue and violet) gets scattered in all directions more than longer-wavelength light (like red, orange, and yellow). However, we see the sky as blue rather than violet because our eyes are more sensitive to blue light and because sunlight reaches us more from the blue part of the spectrum compared to violet, as violet light gets scattered more. Additionally, ozone in Earth's atmosphere absorbs some of the violet light. The reason we sometimes see red or orange during sunrise or sunset is because at those times of day, the sunlight has to pass through a lot more atmosphere, which selectively scatters the shorter-wavelength blue and green light leaving longer-wavelength red, orange, and yellow light to reach our eyes.\n"
